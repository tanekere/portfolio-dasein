An Arduino-based PLC system built in 3 moths working with Prince Sakariya, Kuldeep Mangaroliya, Dhruvin Vekariya, Shardul Joshi and Vaibhav Gujarati. This system was built for use as a teaching aid at THWS for classroom demonstrations and lab activities. It uses a single custom built double layer PCB as for it's internal circuits. It features ultra-fast MOSFET outputs capable of PWM. For seamless teaching and debugging use, the inputs also contain a physical override switch which can enable them irrespective of signal it is receiving. Both input and Output are galvanically isolated form the Arduino board. Also features a breadboard for easy use with electronic devices. 

Currently in use at Technical University of Applied Sciences Würzburg-Schweinfurt.
