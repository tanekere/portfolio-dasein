Working alone for a period of 4 months alone, I made several improvements to the structure and function of the elevator system developed at THWS as a teaching aid. Work included writing code, designing parts and various kinds of documentation including Input-Output mappings, circuit diagrams, 2D mechanical drawings and manuals for usage, maintenance and assembly. 
The project consists of a model elevator system with electronic sensors and actuators that is controlled with a PLC signal. It us intended to be used as a teaching aid.

This is currently in use at THWS.
